By which occasion, and some others, rising from an aemulation betweene him and Pompey the great, pretending a high indignation, hee incontinent crossed the Alpes, with such forces (though few) as he had in readinesse, and with a great celeritie came to Rome, which hee found abandoned by Pompey, in whom the Senate had reposed their trust, whom shortly after, by a memorable battell in the fields of Pharsalia he discomfited: and hauing by the ouerthrow of Scipio, death of Cato, and flight of Pompeys sonnes, as it were, rooted out all the contrary faction, hee returned to Rome, and indirectly by the meanes of Antonius, laboured to be proclaimed king: which hauing rendred him altogether odious; Caius Cassius, Marcus Brutus, Decius Brutus, Publius Casca, and diuers others (Noble men) conspired his death, and appointed a day for the same: at which time, notwithstanding that Caesar was disswaded from going foorth, by many monstrous apparitions, and ominous presages; yet being perswaded by Decius Brutus Albinus, hee went towards the fatall place, where the Senate was assembled.\n\nThe Conspirators in like maner, had many terrors amongst others, Portia the wife of Marcus, Brutus, although she had insinuated her selfe in her husbands secret, by a notable proofe of extraordinary magnanimitie, yet on the day dedicated for the execution of their designe, through the apprehension of his danger she fainted diuers times, whereof Brutus was aduertised, yet shrinked not, but went forward with his confederats to the appointed place, where they accomplished their purpose, euery one of them giuing Caesar a wound, and me a ground wherevpon to build this present Tragedie.","quote":"Carmine dij superi placantur, carmine

ministers of wrath.","Ile crosse Cocytus and the smoaking lakes,","To borrow all my brothers damned bandes:","The Furies arm'd with firebrands and with snakes,","Shall plant their hell where Rome so

with those vntimely verses, With raging accents and with dreadfull sounds, To draw dead Monarkes out of ruin'd herses, T'affright th'applauding world with bloudie wounds: Raze all the monuments of horrours past, T'aduance the publike mirth our treasures wast.","And pardon (olde Heroes) for O I finde, I had no reason to admire your fates: And with rare guiftes of body and of minde, Th'vnbounded greatnesse of euill-conquerd states. More glorious actes then were atchieu'd by you, Do make your wonders thought no wonders now.","For yee the Potentates of former times, Making your will a right, your force a law: Staining your conquest with a thousand crimes, Still raign'd like tyrants but obey'd for awe: And whilst your yoake none willingly would beare, Dyed oft the sacrifice of wrath and feare.","But this age great with glorie hath brought forth A matchlesse Monarke whom peace highlie raises, Who as th'vn'tainted Ocean of all worth As due to him hath swallow'd all your praises. Whose cleere excellencies long knowne for such, All men must praise, and none can praise too much. For that which others hardly could acquire, With losse of thousands liues and endlesse paine, Is heapt on him euen by their owne desire, That thrist t'enioy the fruites of his blest raigne: And neuer conquerour gain'd so great a thing, As those wise subiects gaining such a King.","But what a mightie state is this I see? A little world that all true worth inherites, Strong without art, entrench'd within the sea, Abounding in braue men full of great spirits: It seemes this Ile would boast, and so she may, To be the soueraigne of the world some day.","O generous IAMES the glorie of thir parts, In large dominions equall with the best: But the most mightie Monarke of mens harts, That euer yet a Diadem possest: Long maist thou liue, well lou'd & free from dangers, The comfort of thine owne, the terrour of strangers."]},{"type":"encomium","head":"Some verses written shortly thereafter by reason of an Inundation of Douen, a water neere vnto the Authors house, wherevpon his Maiestie was sometimes wont to Hawke.","content":["WHat wonder though my melancholious muse, Whose generous course some lucklesse starre controules: Her bold attempts to prosecute refuse, And would faine burie my abortiue scroules.","To what perfection can my lines be raisd, Whilst many a crosse would quench my kindling fires: Lo for Parnassus by the Poets prais'd, Some sauage mountaines shadow my retires.","No Helicon her treasure here vnlockes, Of all the sacred band the chiefe refuge: But dangerous Douen rumbling through the rockes, Would scorne the raine-bowe with a new deluge.","As Tiber mindefull of his olde renowne, Augments his floodes to waile the faire chang'd place: And greeu'd to glide through that degener'd towne, Toyles with his depthes to couer their disgrace.","So doth my Douen rage greeu'd in like sort, While as his wonted honour comes to minde: To that great Prince whilst he afforded sport, To whom his Trident Neptune hath resign'd.","And as the want of waters and of swaines, Had but begotten to his bankes neglect: He striues t'encroch vpon the bordering plaines, Againe by greatnesse to procure respect.","Thus all the creatures of this orphand boundes, In their own kindes moou'd with the common crosse: With many a monstrous forme all forme confoundes, To make vs mourne more feelingly our losse.","We must our breastes to baser thoughts inure, Since we want all that did aduance our name: For in a corner of the world obscure, We rest vngrac'd without the boundes of fame.","And since our Sunne shines in another part, Liue like th'Antipodes depriu'd of light: Whilst those to whom his beames he doth impart, Begin their day whilst we begin our night.","This hath discourag'd my high-bended minde, And still in doale my drouping Muse arrayes: Which if my Phoebus once vpon me shin'd, Might raise her flight to build amidst his rayes."]}]}}
